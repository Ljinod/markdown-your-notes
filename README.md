# MARKDOWN YOUR NOTES

This Cozy application, once finished, will enable you to take notes using the
Markdown syntax.

The note will dynamically be converted into HTML and you will be able to save it
under several formats: Markdown, HTML, and PDF.

**NOTE**: I am doing this application on my spare time and it should **not** be
considered as an official Cozy application.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Basic layout and functionality: a note is typed in a dedicated area and is
  dynamically converted into HTML in another.
- [ ] Save the note on the Cozy (only the markdown).
- [ ] Select and edit a note from the list of saved notes displayed in a menu.
- [ ] UI enhancements.
