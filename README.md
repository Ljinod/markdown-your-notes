# MARKDOWN YOUR NOTES

This Cozy application, once finished, will enable you to take notes using the
Markdown syntax.

The note will dynamically be converted into HTML and you will be able to save it
under several formats: Markdown, HTML, and PDF.

**NOTE**: I am doing this application on my spare time and it should **not** be
considered as an official Cozy application.
